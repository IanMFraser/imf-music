            <p>My first solo release featuring material using SuperCollider. 
                The Realness primarily studies the behavior of various chaotic oscillators, their 
                timbre, and how they evolve over time. SuperCollider provides a good number of 
                oscillators to choose from. I primarily focused on the Gingerbreadman map, the 
                Double-well Forced Oscillator, and Dynamic Stochastic Synthesis. To modulate
                parameters, I used these same oscillators as lfos scaled to appropriate ranges.

            <p>Recording took place at various times throughout the year. A large chunk of side A is 
                from a live performance in Philadelphia. The rest comes from recordings done at 
                the FUNVAC studio. Some edits were made at the beginning and end of certain recordings 
                and pieced together based on intuition.
